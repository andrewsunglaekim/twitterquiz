= Trendster

Trendster is a fun Twitter quiz app built on Ruby on Rails! It utilizes the twitter Rest API to update its database.

===
Configuration
To run this app:
Fork the repo and clone it to your local machine then run bundle install, some rake commands, and figaro installation in your command terminal:
    $ bundle install
    $ rake db:create
    $ rake db:migrate
    $ rakd db:seed
    $ figaro install

Although the database gets seeded with some initial data, you wont be able to use the app until you incoporate your own Twitter API keys.
To use this app, you must also get access tokens to utilize the Twitter API and adjust the keys in your <code>/config/application.yml</code> file
It should look something like this depending on which environment you want your keys:
    development:
      twitter_consumer_key: <your consumer key here>
      twitter_consumer_secret_key: <your consumer secret key here>
      twitter_access_token: <your access token here>
      twitter_secret_access_token: <your secret access token here>

After you change out the keys you should be able to go into the rails console and run some commands to update the database:
    $ rails c
    > tweeters = Tweeter.all
    > tweeters.each do |tweeter|
    > tweeter.update_attributes
    > end

You should now have a fully seeded database! Fire up the Rails server and play!
